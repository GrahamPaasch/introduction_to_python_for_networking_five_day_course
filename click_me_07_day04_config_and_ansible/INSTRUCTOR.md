# Day 4 Instructor Guide â€” Configuration & Ansible

## Objectives
- Translate REST and telemetry insights into configuration changes.
- Introduce Ansible for network automation while reinforcing idempotent practices.
- Prepare teams to integrate all artifacts into the final capstone.

## Prep
- Verify device credentials and Ansible inventory entries in `click_me_09_gns3_assets/gns3/login-table.md`.
- Review `./labs/05_config_vlan/starter` and `./labs/06_ansible_intro/starter`.
- Pre-test Ansible connectivity inside the course virtual environment.
