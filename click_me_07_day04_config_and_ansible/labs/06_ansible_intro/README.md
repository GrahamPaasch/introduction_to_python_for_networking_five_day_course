# Lab 06 â€” Ansible Intro

Build an Ansible inventory and playbook that applies the rendered configurations with confidence.

## Resources
- Inventory and playbook skeletons: `starter/`
- Instructor-validated outputs and logs: `expected_output/`

## Notes
- Keep secrets out of source control and demonstrate vault usage if time allows.
- Require students to run in check mode before applying changes.
- [TODO: Add customer-specific variables and credential handling guidance.]
