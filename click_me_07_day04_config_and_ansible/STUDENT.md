# Day 4 Student Guide â€” Configuration & Ansible

## What you'll produce today
- Rendered configuration snippets driven by REST and telemetry insights.
- An Ansible inventory and playbook capable of deploying the changes in check mode and apply mode.
- A validation checklist to prove the change succeeded.

## Steps
1. Review upcoming changes in `./labs/05_config_vlan/README.md` and confirm target devices in `click_me_09_gns3_assets/gns3/login-table.md`.
2. Activate the course virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`).
3. Complete Lab 05 using the offline fixtures to render configurations before touching GNS3.
4. Move to Lab 06 to build an Ansible playbook; test in `--check` mode against GNS3.
5. Document diffs and validation evidence for your exit ticket.
6. Note any gaps you must close during tomorrow's capstone rehearsal.
