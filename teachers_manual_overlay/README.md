# Intro to Python for Networking — Teacher Manual (Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour)

**Purpose:** A teacher-first overlay you can drop into your course repo. Each `day-0X/README.md` gives an hour-by-hour plan with instructor notes, links to labs, and plan‑B (offline) flows.

**How to use:**
1. Keep your existing `labs/` code (inventory, connectivity, SNMP/syslog, REST, config, Ansible).
2. Add this overlay folder’s files at the repo root (or merge its contents into your repo).  
3. Start each day from the matching `day-0X/README.md` and follow the hour-by-hour script.
4. Put your GNS3 screenshots into `docs/assets/gns3/` and update links in `docs/gns3.md`.

**Navigation:**  
- [Day 01 — Foundations & Device Access](day-01/README.md)  
- [Day 02 — SNMP & Syslog (Observability)](day-02/README.md)  
- [Day 03 — RESTful APIs for Network Automation](day-03/README.md)  
- [Day 04 — Multi‑Vendor Config & Ansible](day-04/README.md)  
- [Day 05 — Capstone & Demos](day-05/README.md)

> **Assumptions:** 8h/day with two 10‑min breaks and a 45‑min lunch. Adjust times to your start window.  
> **Plan‑B:** Every lab has an offline fallback using fixtures so class proceeds even if the sim is busy.
