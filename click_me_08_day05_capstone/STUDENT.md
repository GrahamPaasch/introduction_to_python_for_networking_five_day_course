# Day 5 Student Guide — Capstone Integration

## What you'll produce today
- A cohesive automation storyline that links inventory, telemetry, REST workflows, and configuration changes.
- A polished presentation with evidence, code pointers, and next-step recommendations.
- A retrospective documenting team lessons learned and production readiness items.

## Steps
1. Consolidate artifacts from Days 1–4 inside your team folder; ensure screenshots in `click_me_09_gns3_assets/gns3/` are up to date.
2. Activate the virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`) to run any final scripts.
3. Build the end-to-end demo flow, validating each stage with offline fixtures before live execution.
4. Rehearse your presentation, ensuring everyone speaks to a portion of the automation story.
5. Capture outstanding risks or follow-ups to highlight during the retrospective.
6. Submit your final artifacts and slide deck to the instructor before presentations begin.
