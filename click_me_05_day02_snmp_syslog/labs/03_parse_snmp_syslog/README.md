# Lab 03 â€” Parse SNMP & Syslog

Convert raw SNMP walk data and syslog messages into normalized structures that augment the device inventory.

## Resources
- Offline SNMP walks and syslog samples: `starter/`
- Reference outputs and validation helpers: `expected_output/`

## Notes
- Emphasize working offline first to avoid noisy lab environments.
- Encourage students to build parsers that tolerate vendor-specific quirks.
- [TODO: Update fixture filenames and OIDs to match the customer estate.]
