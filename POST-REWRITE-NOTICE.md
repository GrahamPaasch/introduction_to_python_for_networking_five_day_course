Heads-up: repository history was rewritten on [TODO: Insert rewrite date] to remove `client_requirements.png`.
Please delete any existing clones and re-clone from `main`; `git pull` is unsafe and will resurrect purged objects.
Force pushes touched all branches and tags to ensure the sensitive file is gone everywhere.
After re-cloning, run `bash environment/bootstrap.sh` to rebuild your Python tooling.
If you maintain forks, rebase them onto the rewritten mainline before opening new PRs.
Contact [TODO: Insert point of contact] if you suspect you still have cached copies of the file.
Thank you for helping keep customer data protected.
