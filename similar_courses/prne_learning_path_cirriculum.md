### Notes and Mapping
- Modules referenced above match the PRNE Learning Path:
  - [1] Intro to Python (Introducing Programming; Scripting, PEP 8, Getting Help)
  - [2] Data Types (Basics; Lists/Tuples/Sets/Dicts; String Manipulation)
  - [3] Conditionals and Loops (Conditionals/Operators; For/While)
  - [4] File I/O (Text/CSV; JSON)
  - [5] Regular Expressions (Intro; Parsing Unstructured Data)
  - [6] Code Reuse (Functions/Namespaces/Scope/Main; Classes/Inheritance; Modules/Packages)
  - [7] User Input (Validation; Command Line)
  - [8] Troubleshooting (Exceptions/Assertions; Debugging; `pdb`)
- The schedule expands on the core content with demos, labs, and a capstone to fill a 5‑day (40‑hour) delivery while reinforcing practical skills.
