Subject: Purge cached artifacts after history rewrite for <repository>

Hello GitHub Support,

Please purge cached objects and pull request diffs for the repository: [TODO: Insert repository URL].

Context:
- On [TODO: Insert rewrite date], we used `git filter-repo` to remove `client_requirements.png` from every ref.
- The commits to invalidate are 14bce63 and 2ffc08d.
- Force pushes were issued for all branches and tags via `git push --mirror --force`.

We need cached tarballs, PR views, GitHub Pages artifacts, and code search indexes refreshed so the removed file cannot be retrieved.

Let us know when the purge is complete or if you need additional confirmation.

Thank you,
[TODO: Your name / contact]
