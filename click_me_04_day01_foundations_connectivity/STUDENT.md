# Day 1 Student Guide â€” Foundations & Connectivity

## What you'll produce today
- A Python-driven device inventory exported to CSV and Markdown.
- Connectivity baselines validated against offline fixtures and GNS3 devices.
- A short reflection summarizing readiness for SNMP/syslog instrumentation.

## Steps
1. Review the lab topology in `click_me_09_gns3_assets/gns3/topology-diagram.png` and confirm device credentials in `click_me_09_gns3_assets/gns3/login-table.md`.
2. Activate the course virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` (run `bash click_me_10_environment_setup/bootstrap.sh` first if needed).
3. Complete Lab 01 (`./labs/01_inventory/README.md`) using the provided starter fixture before touching live gear.
4. Use the offline ping results in `./labs/02_connectivity/starter` to script reachability checks, then repeat against the GNS3 environment.
5. Capture screenshots or terminal output as evidence for your exit ticket recap.
6. Document open questions for tomorrow's SNMP/syslog instrumentation in your team notes.
