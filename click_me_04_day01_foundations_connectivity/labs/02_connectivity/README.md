# Lab 02 â€” Connectivity Baselines

Automate reachability checks using ping, TCP socket tests, and optional traceroutes while comparing against offline fixtures.

## Resources
- Starter scripts and baseline captures: `starter/`
- Expected outputs for reference: `expected_output/`

## Notes
- Encourage students to compare offline fixture results to live GNS3 tests before escalating failures.
- Reinforce logging patterns that will feed Day 2 syslog enrichment.
- [TODO: Embed sanitized ping/traceroute samples for this cohort.]
