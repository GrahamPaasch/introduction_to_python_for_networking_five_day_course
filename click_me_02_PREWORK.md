# Prework

1. Install GNS3 or confirm access to the shared GNS3 server; download the current project bundle. [TODO: Provide GNS3 project link.]
2. Ensure Python 3.10+ and Git are available on your workstation; macOS/Linux recommended.
3. Clone the repository and run `bash click_me_10_environment_setup/bootstrap.sh` to create the course virtual environment ahead of time.
4. Review `click_me_09_gns3_assets/gns3/topology-diagram.png` and `click_me_09_gns3_assets/gns3/login-table.md` so you recognize device roles before Day 1.
5. Verify you can reach the offline fixture share for inventory, connectivity, SNMP, syslog, REST, and Ansible labs. [TODO: Insert fixture share path.]
