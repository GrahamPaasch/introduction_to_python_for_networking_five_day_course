# Lab 01 â€” Inventory

Transform offline device metadata into a shareable inventory using Python dictionaries and structured output.

## Resources
- Starter fixtures and scaffolding: `starter/`
- Expected outputs for validation: `expected_output/`

## Notes
- Begin with the offline dataset before connecting to GNS3 nodes.
- Highlight how students can extend the inventory to include SNMP capabilities on Day 2.
- [TODO: Update fixture filenames and targets for the current customer environment.]
