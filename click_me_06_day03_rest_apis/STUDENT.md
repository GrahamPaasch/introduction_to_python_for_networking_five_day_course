# Day 3 Student Guide â€” REST APIs & Orchestration

## What you'll produce today
- A Python script that authenticates to a REST endpoint and retrieves actionable data.
- A workflow that converts SNMP/syslog insights into RESTful change or ticket updates.
- Notes capturing API limitations and prerequisites for tomorrow's configuration push.

## Steps
1. Review API targets and sample payloads in `./labs/04_rest_apis/starter`.
2. Ensure the course virtual environment is active (`source .venv/bin/activate`).
3. Complete Lab 04 (`./labs/04_rest_apis/README.md`) using the offline fixtures before hitting real APIs.
4. Map telemetry fields from Day 2 into REST payloads and document assumptions.
5. Capture request/response examples for your exit ticket.
6. Identify which responses should feed into Day 4 configuration automation and note required transforms.
