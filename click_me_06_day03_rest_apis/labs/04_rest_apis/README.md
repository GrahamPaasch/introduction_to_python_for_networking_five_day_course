# Lab 04 — REST APIs

Practice authenticating, sending, and parsing REST calls using the `requests` library and offline fixtures.

## Resources
- Mock API responses, Postman collections, and scaffolding: `starter/`
- Validation aids and annotated outputs: `expected_output/`

## Notes
- Emphasize error handling—time-outs, 4xx, and 5xx responses.
- Encourage students to log payloads for reuse in Day 4 Ansible playbooks.
- [TODO: Update mock payloads to reflect current customer services or NMS platforms.]
